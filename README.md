# Learning

This repo is a non-exhaustive annotated bibliography of resources I have used for learning. Materials primarily cover mathematics, computer science, statistics, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in understanding how to build autonomous, inferential agents, so most of the contents is somehow directed towards or tangential to that subject. I am also interested in urban planning and try to read a relatively broad swath of subjects, so I may eventually include sections for these and other subjects. Sections are roughly chronologically ordered, but many of these resources were consumed in parallel.

Where resources can be purchased, links are provided, though these links are not necessarily the "best" way to acquire many of these items. When a material is marked with a checkmark ("✓"), that means it has been completed at least once. However, many of these resources, especially the textbooks, are best utilized as a recurring source of review and learning.

## Textbooks

|Title|Author(s)|Completion Status|Notes|Pre-reqs|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|[Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/125967651X)|Rosen|✓|This is the first mathematics textbook I properly read. It is engaging and provides an excellent introduction to proofs for the computer scientist. |High school algebra, novice programming helpful for grasphing importance|
|[Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X)|Sipser|✓|The canonical introduction to computer science theory. I first read this book in my undergraduate theory of computation course, and have found myself returning to it for refreshers since. |Discrete Mathematics, Calculus, some programming helpful|
|[Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)|Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, & Stein (CLRS)|✓|The most comprehensive formal book on computer algorithms out there. In my experience, this is not a book not grasped all at once. I have found it to be an excellent reference and source of review, though.|Discrete Mathematics, Calculus, intermediate programming helpful|
|[Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Foundations-Christopher-Bishop/dp/3031454677/ref=asc_df_3031454677/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693348626821&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7436683566412610138&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016996&hvtargid=pla-2205744745915&psc=1&mcid=a92c257ef7a03f2bb369f7da7818a295&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwltKxBhDMARIsAG8KnqXjK2LpQYZEkQz2O4xN0hcQPq7hjsbmdSWJHbS68cMx3_aha8VFbjIaAplPEALw_wcB)|Bishop & Bishop|In Progress|As of May 2024, this is the best introduction to deep learning that I have read. Its first two chapters serve as great resources for reviewing probability and information theory. For those interested in diving straight into deep learning, I would recommend this book over e.g. the much recommended Elements of Statistical Learning.|Calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, novice programming ability|
|[Active Inference](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045353/active-inference/)|Parr, Frezullo, Friston|In progress|Excellent book that dives into Friston's "Active Inference", a theory of how intelligent agents update their beliefs with an upper-bounded approximation to ideal Bayesian reasoning. This book has to an extent, become my bible. |Probability Theory, Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Information Theory. This book also benefits from neuroscience, physics, and machine learning perspectives.|

## Online Coursework

|Course Name|Completion Status|Notes|Pre-reqs|
|---|---|---|---|
|[Coursera] [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)|In progress|A straightforward set of videos and short, hand-holding ML projects that pairs well with machine learning textbooks by providing additional perspective, as well as practical coding skills for those unfamiliar with numpy/pandas.|Calculus, Probability, and co-requisite with a more theoretical approach to ML|
|[Coursera] [University of Pennsylvania, Calculus: Single Variable](https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-variable-calculus)|In progress|Excellent review of single variable calculus split into four short courses. Recommended for those that are seeking to review Calculus with a fresh perspective before continuing their mathematics education. Pairs well with a textbook or another source of practice problems. |Calculus I & II|
|https://www.fast.ai/|In progress|||
|[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)|✓|I find myself returning to Khan Acadamy when I am doubting myself, having forgotten a relatively basic trick that I see come up in a later text. In my experience, it is not sufficient for learning a subject in depth, but it can provide quick review and practice for jogging your memory on how to perform certain calculations. I will also forever find comfort in Sal Kahn's voice.|N/A|
