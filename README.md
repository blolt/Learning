# Learning

This repo is a non-exhaustive annotated bibliography of resources I have used for learning. Materials primarily cover mathematics, computer science, statistics, and machine learning. I am interested in understanding how autonomous, inferential agents are built, so most entries are somehow related to that aim. I hope to add more perspectives from neuroscience and biology as I progress. I am also interested in urban planning, . Many of these resources may be best consumed in parallel with other resources in this list.

Where resources can be purchased or viewed for free, links are provided, though these links are not necessarily the "best" way to acquire many of these items. When a material is marked with a checkmark ("✓"), that means I have "completed" it (at least one read-through). However, many of these resources, especially the textbooks, are best utilized as a recurring source of review and learning.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|[The Markov blankets of life: autonomy, active inference and the free energy principle](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2017.0792)|Kirchoff, Friston, Whyte|✓|Among other things, this paper answers "the question of whether the Markov blanket formulation of biological systems is over-broad and thereby explanatorily empty with respect to autonomy" by introducing _adaptive active inference_. This addresses some concerns I have had regarding the seeming tautological nature of Active Inference. I regard it as essential reading for anyone looking to understand how Markov Blankets apply to agents within the Active Inference framework. |The first three chapters of Parr's _Active Inference_ book.|
|[A step-by-step tutorial on active inference and its application to empirical data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249621000973)|Smith, Friston, Whyte|In Progress|||
|[Anomaly Detection via Controlled Sensing and Deep Active Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06288)|Joseph et al.|Second pass in progress|I work on AWS's Cost Anomaly Detection team so frequently consider active inference in the case of anomaly detection. Anomaly detection has little benefited from the deep learning revolution, with classic statistical methods most often out-performing their deep learning counterparts. Furthermore, humans still excel over even our best models. After an anomaly is detected, it must be _root caused_. That is, decomposed into its constituent parts to understand what is actually driving the anomalous behavior. In the ideal, this requires causal reasoning and a contextual understanding of the domain space in which the anomaly occurred. What is considered anomalous also changes over time, sometimes significantly, necessitating self-updating models. A further challenge is that anomalies are by their very nature rare, preventing the possibility of creating training data in most practical applications, and thereby necessitating the use of unsupervised models. All of the challenges of anomaly detection are magnified when considering industrial applications because of the extremely high dimensional data that modern companies are working with. This suggests a need to attenuate anomaly searches to the most high level information, know when and how to investigate further, all with the goal of, in the future, being able to predict when an anomalous event will occur so that it is indeed _not_ anomalous. This is precisely the kind of behavior that active inference supplies.

Put simply, I believe Active Inference's minimization of (variational) free energy may allow for flexible anomaly detection _and_ the following model For those unfamiliar with the field of anomaly detection, I think it may serve as an interesting perspective on active inference. |Familiarity with active inference|
|[Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908)|Doersch|First pass|I am very interested in learning more about variational auto-encoders because of their reliance on variational inference. I have yet to find literature directly relating VAE's with Active Inference, though I have heard of conceptual linkages on Machine Learning Street Talk.|Some Deep Learning|
|[Bayesian surprise attracts human attention](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698908004380)|Itti, Baldi|First pass|This paper provides a fascinating perspective on the utility of surprise to active agents _instead of_ Shannon entropy, which is in my opinion not trivially apparent. This gives a simple and beautiful intuition behind why surprise is important.|N/A|
|[Reward Maximization Through Discrete Active Inference](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/35/5/807/115249/Reward-Maximization-Through-Discrete-Active)|Da Costa et al.|First pass|I really enjoyed the literature review of this paper, though I have not gotten much farther along in it. This is a fairly dense paper that contains many theoretically interesting proofs and comparisons to other forms of agential learning (e.g. Reinforcement Learning). I intend to review it further once I have completed further study in deep learning and reinforcement learning, which is currently in progress.|Reinforcement learning, deep learning, active inference.|

|---|---|---|---|
|[Coursera] [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)|In progress|A straightforward set of videos and short, hand-holding ML projects that pairs well with machine learning textbooks by providing additional perspective, as well as practical coding skills for those unfamiliar with numpy/pandas.|Calculus, Probability, and co-requisite with a more theoretical approach to ML|
|[Coursera] [University of Pennsylvania, Calculus: Single Variable](https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-variable-calculus)|In progress|Excellent review of single variable calculus split into four short courses. Recommended for those that are seeking to review Calculus with a fresh perspective before continuing their mathematics education. Pairs well with a textbook or another source of practice problems. |Calculus I & II|
|https://www.fast.ai/|In progress|A good course, though my progress on it is stalled because my non-work laptop is having issues, and I am wary of downloading some of the files necessary for the course on my work laptop.|Python and intermediate coding ability.|
|[University of Tubingen - Probablistic ML](https://youtu.be/TTo2kjrAuTo?si=CWq132yI_BV3RtiD)|Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig|On lecture 4|The perfect graduate-level lecture series for probablistic ML for my level of understanding. For those that have not taken a theoretical probability course that emphasises a Bayesian perspective, I highly recommend this one. It is a blast.|Calculus, linear algebra, prior exposure to probability assumed.|
|[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)|✓|I find myself returning to Khan Acadamy when I am doubting myself, having forgotten a relatively basic trick that I see come up in a later text. In my experience, it is not sufficient for learning a subject in depth, but it can provide quick review and practice for jogging your memory on how to perform certain calculations. The duolingo of mathematics, perhaps. I will also forever find comfort in Sal Kahn's voice.|N/A|

TODO: Flesh this section out. To be honest I am sometimes concerned with the fact that anything I might invent is technically owned by Amazon--I believe this stifles innovation. Like the recent [FTC ban on non-competes](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes), I would like to see this rule done away with. Some ideas I have, anyways:

1. Good ol' cartpole and perhaps some other reinforcement learning problems.
2. Personal smart speaker using Claude 3 with some interesting tools for it to use. This is in progress, though tools need to be thought on more.
